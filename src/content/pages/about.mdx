I am Balamurugan K, documenting every scrap of evidence that cooperative federalism protects dignity for every linguistic, religious, caste, and regional community. This space will keep expanding with Tamil translations, downloadable manifestos, and public schedules so that anyone can trace how the book *Federalism Under Siege* is assembled.
