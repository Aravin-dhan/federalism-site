In
any functioning democracy, the tax system is a social contract. A citizen pays
taxes with the expectation that the state will utilise those funds to provide
security, infrastructure, and welfare. In a federal nation like India, this
contract has a second layer: the agreement between the States and the Union.
The States collect revenue and surrender a portion to the Union, with the constitutional
guarantee that a fair share will be returned to fund local development.

However,
over the last decade, a quiet structural shift has occurred in India’s fiscal
architecture. Through complex accounting mechanisms and changes in the
"terms of reference" for wealth distribution, the link between a
state’s economic contribution and its development returns has been severed.

To
understand why states like Tamil Nadu face perpetual funding crunches for
projects like the Metro Rail or flood relief, one must examine this ledger
itself. There are three specific mechanisms at play: the shrinking of the
"Divisible Pool," the penalty on population control, and the
disparity in tax devolution.

## A Shrinking Pie

The
Constitution of India, under Article 270, mandates that the Union
Government must share the taxes it collects with the States. This shared pot of
money is known as the "Divisible Pool." Historically, this meant that
for every rupee the Centre collected in taxes, a significant portion was
automatically transferred back to the States.

However,
there is an exception clause. The Constitution allows the Union to levy
"Cesses and Surcharges" for specific purposes. Crucially, revenue
collected under the label of "Cess" or "Surcharge" does not
have to be shared with the States. It belongs entirely to the Union Government.

In
recent years, this exception has arguably become the rule. Data from the
Reserve Bank of India and Union Budget documents reveal a stark trend. In the
fiscal year 2010-11, Cesses and Surcharges constituted only about 10.4%
of the Union’s Gross Tax Revenue. By 2020-21, this figure had surged to over 26%.

A
vast majority of the tax you pay on petrol and diesel that tax is categorized
as "Road and Infrastructure Cess" or "Agriculture Infrastructure
Development Cess." Because of this labelling, even though the citizen in
Chennai or Coimbatore pays the tax, the State Government of Tamil Nadu receives
zero share of that specific component.

By
converting "Tax" (shareable) into "Cess" (non-shareable),
the Union Government effectively shrinks the pie before the States even get a
seat at the table.

## The Population Penalty, where States are punished for their success

Once
this Divisible Pool is determined, the Finance Commission decides how to
distribute this money among the states. This is where the second structural
disadvantage emerges.

For
decades, the distribution formula relied heavily on the 1971 Census
population data. This was a strategic decision intended to ensure that states
which successfully implemented family planning and controlled their population
growth were not penalized with less funding.

However,
the 15th Finance Commission (constituted in 2017) shifted the base year
to the 2011 Census. This shift dramatically changed the fiscal
landscape. States like Tamil Nadu, had successfully lowered their fertility
rates to replacement levels (roughly 1.6 to 1.8) over the last forty years. In
contrast, populous states in the North continued to grow.

By
using the 2011 population data, the new formula effectively rewarded states
with higher population growth with a larger share of the tax revenue, while
reducing the share of states that had achieved national family planning goals.
While the Commission introduced a minor "Demographic Performance"
weightage to mitigate this, the overarching impact was a reduction in the share
for developed states. In essence, the states that invested in education and
health to stabilize their population are now paying a "success tax"
to subsidize those that did not.

## The Return on Investment

The
combined effect of the Cess loophole and the population weightage creates a
stark disparity in the "Return on Investment" for different states.

When
we analyze the devolution data, a clear pattern of redistribution emerges. For
every ₹1 that Tamil Nadu contributes to the Union exchequer, it receives
back approximately 29 paise. The remaining 71 paise is retained by the
Union or redistributed to other states.

In
comparison, for every ₹1 contributed, Uttar Pradesh receives
approximately ₹2.73, and Bihar receives roughly ₹7.06.

It
is a core principle of federalism that developed regions support lesser
developed regions to ensure balanced national growth. No reasonable economist
argues against this. However, the scale of this redistribution raises questions
about sustainability. When the gap becomes this wide, the "donor"
states face a resource crunch that hampers their own ability to maintain
infrastructure and attract investment.

If
a manufacturing hub like Tamil Nadu cannot afford to upgrade its power grids,
ports, or urban transit systems because its revenue is being disproportionately
siphoned off, it eventually hurts the entire Indian economy. A slowed engine
cannot pull the train.

 

The
current fiscal structure operates on a mechanism where the Union Government has
maximized its retained revenue through Cesses, while simultaneously shifting
the distribution formula to favour population bulk over efficiency. 

We
must ask ourselves, does the current system incentivize performance, literacy,
and population control? Or does it create a moral hazard, where states are given
incentives to fail to improve social indicators by being rewarded with larger
financial transfers, funded from the states that succeeded?
