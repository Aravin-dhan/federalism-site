## Why begin here?

This starter essay captures the scaffolding for the forthcoming long-form series. Each section of the project will be translated into Tamil and syndicated as RSS + newsletter issues. The working manuscript is intentionally structured as modular notebooks so that Keystatic can remix the same assets for Medium, Substack, or PDF briefs without reflowing copy.

### Immediate todos

- Map archival sources for Chapters 1-4 directly into the `/resources` collection so they can be cited inline.
- Build Tamil + English glossaries for contested concepts (basic structure, asymmetric federalism, fiscal coercion).
- Wire newsletter plumbing so that every post can surface `draft`, `review`, or `scheduled` state transitions in the CMS UI.

> Federalism is not nostalgia; it is infrastructure for justice.
